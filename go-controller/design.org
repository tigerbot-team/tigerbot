* General gleanings from Discord
- ToF trouble with black walls is because black reflects less light -
  but apparently they start working at <= 250mm

* Subsystems
- Joystick control
- Movement
- Heading hold
- ToF
- Camera
- Gun targetting

* Challenges

** Lava Palava
- Straightish line speed test, autonomous
- Straight line with a kink, 7m long in total
- White line down middle
- Speed hump somewhere 53x570mm
- Q. Do we already know where the speed hump will be?
- Q. Are we allowed to observe this and build in knowledge on the day?
- Dead reckoning
- White line following by camera
- ToF if we can rely on reflections from walls
- Camera observing walls
- Q. Do we need to allow for speed hump at all?  Can we go fast enough
  for this to matter?
- Q. If so, how do we spot it approaching?

** Eco Disaster
- Barrels, autonomous
- Barrel positions and colours will be marked on the floor and will be
  the same for all teams.
- Gleanings from Discord
  - No guaranteed minimum distance between barrels
  - Still deciding whether we can use prior knowledge of barrel
    positions

** Escape Route
- Maze, autonomous
- Maze in one of 6 arrangements, which we won't know in advance, or be
  able to see when starting the challenge.
- Blue block has biggest Y measurement
- Green block has medium Y measurement
- Red block has smallest Y measurement
- Always same Y offset from the Ymax of one block to the Ymin of the
  next
- Same X measurements for all blocks
- Gleanings from Discord
  - Will be blind even for autonomous bots, so maybe need a video feed?

** Minesweeper
- Light squares
- Identify which square lit, move to it (any part of robot on the
  square), be motionless for 1s
- Repeat up to 20 times
- Clearly can only be done by camera, and I think we need to know what
  field of view we can get with the camera mounted at a certain
  height, and angled horizontal or slightly down.  If there is a
  height and angling with which we can see the whole area at once,
  then question is whether cable will reach from the Pi to that
  height, or if we can get an extension cable.


** Zombie Apocalypse
- Shooting targets, including elevated ones
- Need shooting mechanism and target identification

** Pi Noon
- Mostly RC, but believe some autonomy is allowed
- Maybe to take over targeting when we get close

** Temple of Doom
- RC, no autonomy possible
